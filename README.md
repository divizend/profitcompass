# The Profit Compass

"The Profit Compass" is a fully AI-generated podcast on financial literacy created by the German FinTech [Divizend](https://divizend.com/). We were founded in 2020, and after having established ourselves as the European market leader in withholding tax reclaims for private and institutional customers, Divizend is now exploring the limits of hyperpersonalized, AI-based financial education.
